I have an anxiety problem.
I thought I was an anti-social person.
But I am not.
I guess...
...it is just the anxiety.

I like hanging out with friends.
But only with ones I am comfortable with.
I guess...
...it is just the anxiety.

I like to work around people. Cafe is a good spot.
But I don't want anyone to talk to me.
I guess...
...it is just the anxiety.

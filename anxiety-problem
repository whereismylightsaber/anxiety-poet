I have an anxiety problem.
I thought I was an anti-social person.
But people say I am an extrovert.
I guess...
...it is just the anxiety.

I like hanging out with friends.
But only with ones I am comfortable with.
I guess...
...it is just the anxiety.

I like to work around people. Cafe is a good spot.
But I don't want anyone to talk to me.
I guess...
...it is just the anxiety.

I like to spend time outside.
But only to places I have been.
I guess...
...it is just the anxiety.

I incline to the idea of exprssing myself through poem.
But I wonder if my feeling is actually captured.
Or will this writing just be another piece of digital refusal.
I do not know.
I wish I could know.
I guess...
...it is just the anxiety.
